# Local SEO

## Google Business Profile
- Claim and verify your listing — unverified profiles don't rank
- Complete ALL fields: hours, services, attributes, products
- Primary category: choose the most specific match (not generic "Business")
- Photos: businesses with photos get 42% more direction requests
- Posts: weekly updates show activity, appear in Knowledge Panel
- Q&A: seed with common questions, monitor for spam

## NAP Consistency
- NAP = Name, Address, Phone — must be IDENTICAL everywhere
- Format matters: "Street" vs "St." is a mismatch to Google
- Check major directories: Yelp, Yellow Pages, Facebook, Apple Maps, Bing Places
- Use local phone number — toll-free looks non-local
- Update NAP when moving — inconsistency tanks rankings for months

## Local Keywords
- "[Service] + [City]" pages for each location served
- "near me" queries: proximity + relevance + prominence
- Neighborhood/district names for dense metros
- Location in title tag: "Plumber in Austin, TX | Company Name"
- Service area pages: one per city, unique content each

## Reviews
- Quantity + recency + rating: all three matter for local pack
- Respond to ALL reviews — especially negative, shows engagement
- Never buy fake reviews — Google detects patterns, leads to suspension
- Review velocity: steady flow better than sudden burst
- Ask at point of transaction — "leave a review" links in receipts/emails

## Citations
- Structured citations: business directories with NAP
- Unstructured citations: mentions in articles, blogs, news
- Industry-specific directories: lawyers on Avvo, restaurants on TripAdvisor
- Chamber of commerce and local business associations
- Data aggregators (Factual, Localeze) push to multiple directories

## Local Content
- Location pages with unique content — not just NAP + map
- Local news/events coverage — shows community involvement
- Case studies with local clients — builds local relevance signals
- Embed Google Maps — helps Google verify location
