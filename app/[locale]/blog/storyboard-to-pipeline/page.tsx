        Most people think AI video means "text in, clip out." But if you're aiming
        for <strong>cinematic, director-level control</strong>, itâ€™s an entirely
        different game.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        In traditional animation, every detail matters â€” character design, motion
        continuity, timing, and scene transitions. Our goal is to make AI match
        that level of precision.

      <p className="mb-4 clear-left">
        Thatâ€™s why we build <strong>Controlled Generation Pipelines</strong> instead
        of one-shot generation. These pipelines combine structure and creativity:

      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-8 space-y-1">
        <li>Storyboard-to-Video: ensures visual + narrative alignment</li>
        <li>ComfyUI-based workflows: modular, reproducible, composable</li>
        <li>Temporal & multimodal control: image + voice + scene coherence</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Animation today is both an art and a structured orchestration challenge. We
        think like directors, but build like engineers.
