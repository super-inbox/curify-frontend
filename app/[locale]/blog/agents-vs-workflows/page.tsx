        Many successful AI creators today (like NanoBanana) rely on{" "}
        <strong>carefully engineered workflows</strong> ‚Äî scripted pipelines for
        writing, dubbing, editing, and publishing.

        But agents are different. As Anthropic puts it:
        <em> ‚ÄúWorkflows are predictable. Agents are adaptive.‚Äù</em>
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">

      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-8 space-y-1 clear-left">
        <li>Post-editing translations based on context</li>
        <li>Adjusting pacing or emotional tone in dubs</li>
        <li>Understanding intent and speaker sentiment</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The future of creative automation lies in harmony: workflows provide
        <strong> control</strong>, agents bring <strong>creativity</strong>.
