# Search Evaluation Query Set

_Auto-generated from `scripts/configs/search_eval_set.json` (2026-05-19, last recalibrated 2026-05-30 (weekly cycle 1: appended 3 user-weekly-2026-05-30 queries — chiikawa, samurai, genshin — surfaced as under-served fandoms by the 14d admin /interaction-analytics pull and shipped a content topup the same cycle. Net set: 57 queries — 54 prior + 3 weekly. Prior recalibration 2026-05-29 appended 8 Pinterest discovery keywords.)). Re-run `python3 scripts/render_eval_set_md.py` after editing the JSON._

54-query regression + coverage set for /search, now scoring TWO surfaces: (a) inspiration richness via the strict/relaxed matcher (existing `expected` field), and (b) template richness via the LLM matcher (`expected_templates` — # templates with matcher confidence >= 0.4, mirroring the production GenerableTemplatesSection threshold).

Mix: (a) real user queries, (b) Reddit-eval queries with structural-stopword noise stripped, (c) user-reported bad cases, (d) long-tail / popular / gsc-zero queries, (e) ProgSEO long-tail queries (added 2026-05-27) covering the empty-inspiration + rich-template case the Generation Bridge was built for, (f) Pinterest discovery keywords (added 2026-05-29) — real Pinterest search terms harvested while doing B2B lead discovery, that double as entity-shape queries Curify users would type.

Re-run `scripts/eval_search.cjs` (cheap) for inspiration drift; re-run `scripts/eval_search.cjs --matcher` (incurs LLM cost ~$0.09 across the full set) to also check template-richness drift after any change to lib/searchTemplateMatch.ts, the taxonomy, or the template catalog.

## Expected legend — inspiration richness (`expected`)

| Bucket | Means |
| --- | --- |
| `rich` | >= 10 effective inspirations (strict if any; else relaxed-OR fallback) |
| `moderate` | 3-9 effective inspirations |
| `thin` | 1-2 — should also fire search_lowresult event |
| `empty` | 0 — should fire search_noresult event (UNLESS rewriter recovers, in which case page renders rewrites and no event fires) |
| `rewrite_recovery` | original is thin/empty, LLM rewrite is expected to surface catalog hits via union |
| `rewrite_empty` | LLM rewrite should return [] (unmappable query — gibberish, proper noun, off-catalog) |

## Expected legend — template richness (`expected_templates`)

| Bucket | Means |
| --- | --- |
| `rich` | 3+ templates surfaced by matchTemplatesForQuery with confidence >= 0.4 — query has a clear generative answer + alternatives |
| `moderate` | 2 templates — one primary + one backup |
| `thin` | 1 template — single option, ok for narrow queries |
| `empty` | 0 templates — no generative answer (true concept gap) |

**Tolerance:** template-richness verdict accepts ±1 bucket drift as PASS (LLM matcher temperature 0.2 produces run-to-run noise at that level). 2-bucket drift → WARN, 3-bucket drift → FAIL.

**Redirect bypass note:** Some queries (tag slugs like `english-chinese`) trigger a redirect to /topics/<slug> on the live /search page. The eval intentionally bypasses that redirect and scores the query against the catalog directly — same scoring path /search would take if redirects were disabled. The point: even for queries that redirect today, we want to know that the search-results page itself stays healthy, since a regression in the redirect logic could land users on /search instead.

| # | Query | Expected (inspirations) | Expected (templates) | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `单词` | `rich` | `moderate` | Real user query (zero CTR on prod). Means `word/vocabulary` — top templates: mbti-animal, word-scene, kids-vocabulary, species-science. 211 hits. |
| 2 | `卡通` | `rich` | `moderate` | Real user query (zero CTR). Means `cartoon`. Top: education-card, travel, mbti-contrast — cartoon-style templates dominate. 191 hits. |
| 3 | `吉伊卡哇` | `rich` | `thin` | Real user query (zero CTR — production users don't click these results, suggesting low precision). Chiikawa is a Japanese kawaii character franchise; no template covers it specifically. CJK bigram match on `卡哇` surfaces 11 kawaii-tagged inspirations from 2 templates — recall-positive but intent-mismatch. True content gap for the specific franchise; precision issue worth a future ranker fix. |
| 4 | `家居装饰` | `rich` | `moderate` | Real user query (zero CTR). Means `home decoration`. Top: interior-design-mood-board-generator, houseplant-care-guide, soft-decoration-design-guide. 17 hits. |
| 5 | `工程` | `rich` | `empty` | Real user query (zero CTR). Means `engineering`. Sits just above the rich threshold at 10 hits — architecture, industrial-design-concept-sketch, mbti-siliconvalley. Borderline; a content removal could flip to moderate. |
| 6 | `植物` | `rich` | `rich` | Real user query (zero CTR). Means `plants`. Top: herbal, species-science, country-souvenirs-watercolor, CVC-flower-card. 174 hits. |
| 7 | `水果中文` | `empty` | `moderate` | Real user query (zero CTR). Means `fruits Chinese` — concatenated form (no space). Bigrams `水果`/`果中`/`中文` should match en-zh fruit vocab BUT current matcher fails the multi-token strict path. Tokenization gap candidate — suggest user types `水果 中文` with space, or upgrade bigram-OR fallback. |
| 8 | `电商详情图` | `rich` | `moderate` | Real user query (zero CTR). Means `e-commerce detail image`. Top: fashion-ecommerce. 21 hits — narrow but rich. |
| 9 | `自行车` | `rich` | `moderate` | Real user query (100% CTR in source data). Means `bicycle`. Was thin (2 hits) until 2026-05-20 bike batch added 6 new examples (mountain-bike + road-bike object-labeling, en-zh cycling vocab, en-fr bike anatomy, cycling tour packing guide, cycling apparel guide). Base now 6. Adjacent queries also lifted: bike 3→6, cycling 0→4, 骑行 0→9. |
| 10 | `葡萄酒` | `rich` | `moderate` | Real user query (100% CTR). Means `wine`. Path: 2 (pre-batch) → 5 (2026-05-20 wine batch) → 10 (2026-05-21 patch-6 + wine-variety-intro batch + improved auto-tag bilingual coverage). Now rich at 10 hits across regional-alcoholic-drinks, vocabulary, food, lifestyle-info-card, wine-variety-intro. |
| 11 | `蔬菜` | `rich` | `moderate` | Real user query (zero CTR). Means `vegetables`. Top: vocabulary, word-scene, gardening-how-to-infographic. 23 hits. |
| 12 | `词汇` | `rich` | `moderate` | Real user query (zero CTR). Means `vocabulary`. Top: mbti-animal, vocabulary, kids-vocabulary-poster, language-word-comparison. 265 hits. |
| 13 | `趣味经济学知识科普` | `rich` | `rich` | Real user query (zero CTR). Means `interesting economics knowledge popularization`. Compound CJK query — bigrams (趣味/经济/学知/知识/科普) match broadly across science-popularization and trending-knowledge templates. 15 base hits via bigram-OR. Precision likely loose given the zero CTR — top templates may not be specifically economics-themed. Open content gap for economics-specific infographics. |
| 14 | `音乐` | `rich` | `thin` | Real user query (100% CTR). Means `music`. Top: music-style-visual-infographic, vocabulary, movie-poster. 29 hits — well-covered by the 2026-05-19 patch-5 drop. |
| 15 | `食物` | `rich` | `moderate` | Real user query (zero CTR). Means `food`. Top: cuisine-food-vocab-poster, vocabulary, food-photo-doodle-sticker-overlay, bilingual-object-structure-labeling. 69 hits. |
| 16 | `香薰` | `moderate` | `thin` | Real user query (zero CTR pre-2026-05-20). Means `aromatherapy / scented candle`. 2026-05-20 content-gap batch added 5 dedicated examples (product-poster aromatherapy diffuser, soft-decoration aromatherapy spa retreat bedroom, interior-design aromatherapy spa corner, herbal lavender, lifestyle-info aromatherapy essential oils) with `香薰` / `精油` / `aromatherapy` aliases. Was empty/gap; now moderate at 5 hits across 4 distinct templates. |

Moderate is the honest bucket for a niche fandom. Companion: existing CJK form 吉伊卡哇 already in the set. |

| 1 | `maps` | `rich` | User-reported precision issue 2026-06-05: `/search?q=maps` surfaced off-intent template examples (recall-high, precision-weak). Fix shipped same day: added `map` slot to TIER2_SUGGESTIONS in `lib/searchIndex.ts` with multi-language aliases (`地图` / `地圖` / `地図` / `マップ` / `mapa` / `carte` / `landkarte` / `지도` / `नक्शा` / `карта` / `harita` / …) so `maps` + `map` + foreign-language equivalents now REDIRECT to `/topics/map` (8 templates, 75 inspirations).

## How to use this set for side-by-side comparison

For each query in this table, type it verbatim into both
Curify (`/search?q=<query>`) and Pinterest, then compare:

- Does the platform return any results at all?
- How relevant are the top 4–6 results to the query intent?
- Are CJK queries handled (`葡萄酒`, `音乐`, `自行车`, `端午节`)?
- Are hyphenated / compound queries handled (`english-chinese`, `水果中文`)?
- Where the `expected` column says `empty`, do both platforms
  fail equally, or does one surface adjacent content the other
  misses?

Capture findings in a sibling table for each platform; any
query where Curify is materially worse than Pinterest becomes
a thread-a (recall) or thread-c (content) backlog item.
