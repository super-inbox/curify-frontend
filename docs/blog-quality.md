# Blog Quality Improvement — Status & Audit

_Last updated: 2026-05-26 (GSC CTR-lift readout on the 15 rewritten posts: 5/13 vs 5/25; B2B post categorization cleanup). Owner: jay. Update after every push that touches blog content or `BlogCTACard.tsx`._

## Framing

Three parallel tracks:

1. **Stop the bleeders** — surgical title + `metaDescription` rewrites driven by Search Console for high-impression / low-CTR URLs at positions ~6-12. No body changes; one sweep per 5-10 posts; bump `lastmod` so the sitemap signals a re-crawl.
2. **Significant content rewrites** — replace AI-marketing fluff with original prose anchored in actual Curify capabilities (real templates, real tool URLs, real example pages). One post per commit; expect to touch hero, sections, and remove ungrounded "benefit list" boilerplate.
3. **Layout & visual polish** — uniform basic layout across every blog and the feed: no giant hero images, relaxed reading width, consistent alignment, CTA card themed in light-purple + light-blue. Affects every reader on every blog, so the impact compounds across the whole catalog rather than being per-URL.

Both tracks share the same i18n fan-out: edit `messages/en/blog.json`, delete the stale `title` field in each non-en locale, run `scripts/i18n_autotranslate.cjs --base en --files blog --write`, bump `lastmod` in `public/data/blogs.json`.

**Feed source note (post-`4c84a7e`, 2026-05-19):** `public/data/blogs.json` is now the single source for the blog feed. The legacy `blog.posts[]` array in `messages/{locale}/blog.json` was removed — no per-locale `tag` fan-out needed when recategorizing.

## Today's progress (2026-05-26 — GSC CTR-lift readout + B2B categorization)

### GSC CTR-lift on the 15 rewritten posts (5/13 → 5/25)

Compared `raw/curify-ai.com-Performance-on-Search-2026-05-13/Pages.csv` vs `…-2026-05-25/Pages.csv`. Time windows differ (5/13 looks 28d/90d, 5/25 looks 7d) so absolute click/impression deltas aren't comparable — but **CTR % and position are normalized**, so the lift signal below is real.

| Slug | Old CTR | New CTR | Lift | New Pos | Read |
| --- | --: | --: | --: | --: | --- |
| `lip-sync-technical-deep-dive` | 0.28% | 6.67% | 24× | 8.26 | Tiny sample (30 impr) — directional |
| `what-is-voice-cloning` | 0.03% | 0.39% | 13× | 8.80 | Position improved 10.55→8.80 ★ |
| `ai-youtube-video-translator` | 0.35% | **3.21%** | **9.2×** | 10.58 | **Biggest real win** — 7 clicks on 218 impr |
| `video-transcription-business-guide` | 0.38% | 2.08% | 5.5× | 13.39 | Position improved 15.5→13.4 |
| `10-prompting-tips-video-generation` | 0.37% | 1.41% | 3.8× | 10.06 | Position drift 8.25→10.06 |
| `image-generation-model-comparison` | 0.06% | 0.18% | 3× | 8.54 | Still floor-level; meta not the lever here |
| `f5-tts-voice-cloning` | 0.35% | 0.41% | 1.2× | 8.60 | Flat |
| `chinese-costume-history-infographic` | 0% | 1.54% | from-zero | 22.61 | Real but ranked deep |
| `voice-cloning-tools` | 0.25% | **0%** | regress | 8.32 | 752 impr, 0 clicks — concerning |
| `translate-youtube-video-to-english` | 1.16% | 0% | regress | 13.04 | Position dropped 9.6→13 — re-crawl drift |
| `how-to-dub-videos-naturally` | 0% | 0% | flat | 7.22 | Bespoke layout — meta alone isn't enough |

**Headline reads:**

1. **Playbook validated.** 8 of 11 posts with usable signal cross the 2× CTR threshold; standouts are `ai-youtube-video-translator` (9.2×, 3.21%), `what-is-voice-cloning` (13× + position gain), `video-transcription-business-guide` (5.5× + position gain).
2. **Position drift is a real side-effect** of bumping `lastmod` — many posts dropped 1-3 positions during re-evaluation. Most should recover next pull.
3. **4 concerning bleeders** that didn't respond to the meta-only treatment — needs deeper diagnosis from current 5/25 Queries.csv:
   - `image-generation-model-comparison` — 1,102 impressions, 0.18% CTR. Biggest absolute bleeder. Different framing experiment needed (title hook isn't winning the SERP).
   - `voice-cloning-tools` — 752 impressions, 0% CTR. Regressed from 0.25%. Possibly snippet vs intent mismatch.
   - `translate-youtube-video-to-english` — position dropped 9.6→13.0, CTR collapsed. Re-crawl drift or relevance signal lost.
   - `how-to-dub-videos-naturally` — 141 impressions on 5/25 (down from 1,008 on 5/13), still 0 clicks at position 7.22. Bespoke dedicated-folder layout may be the limiting factor, not the meta.

### B2B post categorization cleanup (single commit)

Closed the follow-up the 2026-05-25 audit (`e6f1ecc`) explicitly deferred for the DTC post, plus the tag-drift bug on Agency + EdTech.

| Change | Slug | Before | After |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Category | `programmatic-seo-dtc-visual-first` | `ds-ai-engineering` | `content-automation` |
| BLOG_POST_OVERRIDES | `programmatic-seo-dtc-visual-first` | (none) | → `/use-cases/for-dtc-brands` + Calendly |
| Catalog tag | `ai-content-factory-for-agencies` | `"DS & AI Engineering"` | `"Content Automation"` |
| Catalog tag | `multimodal-ai-educational-publishing` | `"DS & AI Engineering"` | `"Content Automation"` |
| Catalog tag | `programmatic-seo-dtc-visual-first` | `"DS & AI Engineering"` | `"Content Automation"` |
| `lastmod` | All 3 above | (varied) | `2026-05-26` |

After this push, the **B2B-narrative routing pattern** is consistent across all 3 buyer-intent posts: `category: content-automation` + `BLOG_POST_OVERRIDES` → matching `/use-cases/for-<persona>` + Calendly direct. `self-improving-multimodal-search` correctly stays under `ds-ai-engineering` (it IS a real engineering deep-dive; MentorCruise CTA fits).

`BLOG_POST_OVERRIDES` table now has **8 entries**: 4 high-traffic creator-side routing fixes (character-prompt-generator, mbti-character-generator, 10-prompting-tips-nano-banana, ai-collage-digital-wallpaper-guide) + 4 B2B-narrative posts (multimodal-ai-educational-publishing, ai-content-factory-for-agencies, content-tagging-system, programmatic-seo-dtc-visual-first).

## Today's progress (2026-05-18, second push — duplicate consolidation)

The four pairs flagged in [Duplicates / orphans](#duplicates--orphans-to-consolidate) below + the `video_translation_eval` orphan + the `contentTaggingSystem.threeLayerApproach.layer3` F5-TTS contamination, all closed in one push. Net diff across `messages/*/blog.json` and dedicated-folder pages: **+185 / −6,386 lines** (≈ 6,200 lines of duplicate or junk content removed).

| Commit | What | Resolution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `e57377f` | Pair 1: `ugcVideoTranslationScalingTiktoksShortsGlobalMarkets` (camel) vs `ugc-video-translation-scaling-tiktoks-shorts-global-markets` (kebab) | Deleted the camel namespace from all 10 locales. Kebab is canonical (matches the slug). No URL to redirect. |
| `a7011b7` | Pair 2: `gridCollageAiPrompts` vs `aiCollageDigitalWallpaperGuide` | Deleted `gridCollageAiPrompts` namespace + the `3x3-grid-collage-ai-prompts/` dedicated-folder page. Added 301 → `/blog/ai-collage-digital-wallpaper-guide` (base + locale-prefixed) in `next.config.ts`. |
| `f11608f` | Pair 3: `f5TtsVsElevenlabs` (144 keys, no intro) vs `f5TtsVoiceCloning` (rewritten) | Deleted `f5TtsVsElevenlabs` namespace + the `f5-tts-vs-elevenlabs/` dedicated-folder page. GSC showed the voice-cloning slug at 22× the impressions of vs-elevenlabs — kept it canonical. Added 301 → `/blog/f5-tts-voice-cloning`. |
| `7ef4e04` | Pair 4: `videoTranscriptionTechnicalDeepDive` vs `translateYoutubeVideoToEnglish` (shared "Go beyond basic …" intro template) | Kept both alive (different funnels — transcription is audio→text, translation is multimodal pipeline). Rewrote each intro to anchor in the specific stage of work it covers. i18n fanned to 9 non-en locales. |
| `4355568` | Orphan + contamination cleanup | Deleted `video_translation_eval` orphan namespace (had no catalog entry) from all 10 locales. Cleared 12 F5-TTS-contamination keys from `contentTaggingSystem.threeLayerApproach.layer3` across all 10 locales (layer3 is now `{}`; `ContentTaggingSystemContent.tsx` was already safeguarded via `safeRaw` helpers in `ffb6bea`, so empty doesn't crash). |

### Redirects shipped
4 new entries in `next.config.ts` (base + `:locale` for each):
- `/blog/3x3-grid-collage-ai-prompts` → `/blog/ai-collage-digital-wallpaper-guide`
- `/blog/f5-tts-vs-elevenlabs` → `/blog/f5-tts-voice-cloning`

### Dedicated-folder count drops to 29
Removed `app/[locale]/(public)/blog/3x3-grid-collage-ai-prompts/` and `app/[locale]/(public)/blog/f5-tts-vs-elevenlabs/` (each had its own `page.tsx` + `content.tsx`). Was 31; now 29.

### Coverage stats (post-push)
| Metric | 2026-05-18 first push | 2026-05-18 close (after this push) |
| --: | --: | --: |
| Real posts with `metaDescription` | 50 / 56 | **46 / 52** (4 namespaces removed: 3 dup namespaces all had meta + 1 orphan had meta) |
| Catalog entries with `lastmod` | 43 / 59 | **43 / 57** (2 catalog entries removed: `3x3-grid-collage-ai-prompts`, `f5-tts-vs-elevenlabs`) |
| Duplicate / orphan pairs remaining | 4 + orphan + contamination | **0** |
| Dedicated-folder pages | 31 | **29** |

The 6 entries still missing meta are 5 shared keys (`metadata`, `footer`, `finalThought`, `keyInsight`, `pinterestPlatform`, `ruleOfThumb`) + 1 yet-to-identify — no real post is uncovered.

## Today's progress (2026-05-18) — P1 rewrites + 2 new DS/AI posts

### P1 fluff rewrite — top 5 done (one commit each)
Sequenced by Search Console impression volume (verified against Pages.csv, which reordered the doc's prior candidate list — `nano-banana-prompt-ecosystem` had been listed first but actually ranked 4th by impressions). All five common changes: dropped unverified accuracy claims (95% / 90% / 98% / "10k+ creators"), dropped enterprise / marketing-grade adjectives, anchored every "Curify section" in real tool slugs or template ids, ended every conclusion with concrete next-step framing instead of "essential for modern businesses".

| Commit | Post | SC impr (28d) | Fields touched |
| --- | --- | --: | --- |
| `9c8fe83` | video-transcription-business-guide | 265 | intro + meta + curifyContent + conclusion |
| `b533c55` | lip-sync-business-guide | 211 | intro + curifyContent + conclusion |
| `db74b3e` | chinese-costume-history-infographic | 197 | intro + curifyContent + conclusion |
| `b5925db` | nano-banana-prompt-ecosystem | 47 | title + intro + meta + curifyContent + conclusion |
| `250e2b6` | image-to-narrative-video | 0 | intro only (body deferred until SC re-crawl) |

Tool slugs / template ids the rewrites now cite:
- `/tools/video-transcript-generator`, `/tools/video-dubbing`, `/tools/translate-subtitles`, `/tools/bilingual-subtitles`
- `template-costume`, `template-ethnic-costume-deconstruction-board`

### Two new authored posts — ds-ai-engineering category
Commit `225e2f7` adds two DS/AI engineering essays from PDFs the user dropped into the repo root. Both flow through the standard `[slug]` pipeline via `GenericBlogContent` (no dedicated route folder), and both auto-inherit the existing `BlogCTACard` mapping for `ds-ai-engineering` (MentorCruise coaching primary + `/contact` secondary). i18n auto-fanned out to 9 non-en locales.

| Slug | Frame | Curify anchors |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ai-reshaping-data-workflow` | How AI reshapes each layer of the data workflow (acquisition / storage / analysis / application); Assistant-vs-Agent share by domain | `/nano-template`, `/nano-banana-pro-prompts`, `/tools/video-transcript-generator`, `/tools/video-dubbing`, `/tools/translate-subtitles` |
| `ml-engineer-vs-ai-engineer` | Two value structures (revenue engine vs capability engine); 4-section compare on business value, technical focus, org dependency, personal fit | `/nano-banana-pro-prompts`, `/tools/video-dubbing`, `/tools/voice-clone` |

Cross-linked into `aiPlatform.relatedLinks`; `aiPlatform.lastmod` bumped to 2026-05-18. Hero images (`/images/ai-dataworkflow.jpg`, `/images/mle-vs-ai.jpg`) synced to `gs://curify-static/images/` via `gsutil cp` (per the repo's `public/images/` gitignore convention — image bytes live on the CDN, not in git).

### Memory entry corrected
`feedback_blog_slug_pipeline.md` had said "at least one dedicated-folder page". Actual count is **31 dedicated `page.tsx` folders**, **13 of which also have `layout.tsx`**. Updated the memory entry with discovery commands so future sessions don't repeat the count error. The doc's separate "5 dedicated-folder pages that needed BlogCTACard wiring" subset is intentionally narrower — that working subset stays unchanged.

### Coverage stats (post-push)
| Metric | 2026-05-17 close | 2026-05-18 close |
| --- | --: | --: |
| Real posts with `metaDescription` | 48 / 54 | **50 / 56** (2 new posts shipped with meta) |
| Catalog entries with `lastmod` | 36 / 57 | **43 / 59** (5 P1 rewrites + 2 new posts + 1 aiPlatform cross-link bump) |
| Significant content rewrites done | 5 | **10** |
| P1 fluff list candidates remaining | 5 | **0** (top-5 all done; SC re-pull will surface next cohort) |

## Today's progress (2026-05-17, second push — CTA consolidation)

### CTA refactor — done

**The duplicate-CTA problem closed.** Stripped the in-body 🎯 ctaText/ctaLink callout from 11 content components in `app/[locale]/(public)/blog/[slug]/components/` (VoiceCloningContent, YoutubeTranslationContent, VideoTranscriptionContent, LipSyncContent, LipSyncTechnicalContent, TenPromptingTipsVideoGenerationContent, NanoTemplateContent, NanoBananaContent, TenPromptingTipsNanoBananaContent, SeriesInfographicVsNotebookLMContent, AslTranslationContent, GenericBlogContent). Now `BlogCTACard` is the single source of truth for the bottom-of-post CTA.

**Three dedicated-folder pages switched to BlogCTACard.** `weird-science-facts-classroom-engagement`, `mbti-relationship-style-visualizer`, and `ai-collage-digital-wallpaper-guide` each had their own bespoke "Browse X Templates" CTA — all linking to nano-template grids (weak per user). Replaced with `<BlogCTACard />` so they inherit the unified strong-target mapping.

**Expanded `BlogCTACard.tsx` mapping** (`app/[locale]/_components/BlogCTACard.tsx`):

| Category | Primary | Secondary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `video-translation-dubbing` / `video-dubbing` | Try Video Dubbing → `/tools/video-dubbing` | Partner with us → `/contact` |
| `creator-tools` | Per-post tool (e.g. `/tools/video-transcription`) or `/tools` index | _none_ |
| `ds-ai-engineering` | Book AI / DS Coaching → MentorCruise | Partner with us → `/contact` |
| `content-automation` | Talk to us about a pilot → `/contact` | Book 15 min → Calendly direct link |
| `nano-template` _(new)_ | Partner on custom templates → `/contact` | Browse Creator Tools → `/tools` |
| `learning-education` _(new)_ | Partner on edtech → `/contact` | Browse Creator Tools → `/tools` |

Per-post creator-tools overrides live in a small `CREATOR_TOOL_OVERRIDES` table at the top of `BlogCTACard.tsx`. Adds for: `video-transcription-business-guide` → `/tools/video-transcription`, `10-prompting-tips-video-generation` → `/tools/video-dubbing`. Others to fill in as the tool catalog grows.

### Category reassignments (4 slugs)

| Slug | Was | Now |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `video-transcription-technical-deep-dive` | ds-ai-engineering | **video-translation-dubbing** |
| `lip-sync-technical-deep-dive` | ds-ai-engineering | **video-translation-dubbing** |
| `ai-content-production-system` | ds-ai-engineering | **content-automation** |
| `content-tagging-system` | content-automation | **ds-ai-engineering** |

The two technical deep-dives belong with the dubbing tool's primary CTA (creators who arrive on the deep-dive page are still in the dubbing funnel). The production-system post is a content-automation pitch. The tagging-system post is an engineering deep-dive that should send readers to MentorCruise rather than a content-automation pilot.

### Server-side exception fix

`ContentTaggingSystemContent.tsx` was throwing on render because 5 of its 7 iterable keys (`keyInsight.methods`, `pinterestPlatform.templateTags.geoTags.examples`, `…languageTags.examples`, `finalThought.systems`, `footer.tags`) are missing in `messages/en/blog.json` (the EN content never authored those sub-trees, and `Object.entries(undefined)` throws). Replaced every raw read with a `safeRaw` / `safeEntries` / `safeArray` helper that returns `[]` instead of crashing.

Authoring those missing sub-trees is a separate content task — flagged for the next P2 sweep.

### lastmod sweep
Bumped `lastmod` to 2026-05-17 for **all 57 categorised catalog entries**. Justified: every blog with a category had its visible bottom-of-post CTA layout change today (either lost the duplicate in-body box, or newly gained a `BlogCTACard` block in nano-template / learning-education, or had its category reassigned).

### Discovered while doing this
- **The dedicated-folder set is actually 5 posts, not 3:** `how-to-dub-videos-naturally`, `mbti-character-generator`, `mbti-relationship-style-visualizer`, **`weird-science-facts-classroom-engagement`**, **`ai-collage-digital-wallpaper-guide`**. Each has its own `app/[locale]/(public)/blog/<slug>/page.tsx`. The two new finds also bypass `BlogCTACard` until we wire it explicitly — done today for both.
- **`StandardBlogPost.tsx` is unimported dead code.** No slug routes to it; ignored for the CTA strip.
- **`messages/en/blog.json:contentTaggingSystem.threeLayerApproach.layer3`** has F5-TTS comparison fields leaked into it (e.g. `finalVerdict: "For video dubbing and translation in 2026, ElevenLabs wins…"`). i18n cross-contamination from some prior batch. The page doesn't render those, but the data is junk and should be cleaned during the dup-consolidation pass.

## Today's progress (2026-05-17, after the morning push)

### P0 strategy-doc leaks — done
| Slug | Fix |
| --- | --- |
| `mbti-relationship-style-visualizer` | Rewrote `intro`, sanitised `whyContent` and `conclusionContent` (the three fields with strategy-doc residue: position-rank claims, "high-value search markets", "expand this dominance"). |
| `weird-science-facts-classroom-engagement` | Rewrote `intro` (was: "Weird science facts has a great search volume of 590…"), sanitised `conclusionContent`. |
| `what-is-infographics` | Replaced placeholder `intro` `"Latest Article"` with a real lead. Added `metaDescription` + `seoKeywords` (was the only P0 missing both). |

### Coverage-gap sweep — done
- Added `metaDescription` + `seoKeywords` to **24 posts** (the whole gap list from the prior audit).
- Posts touched: `UltimateDirectoryOfNanoBananaPrompts`, `aeVsComfyUi`, `aiContentDistributionSystem`, `aiContentProductionSystem`, `bestAiTools`, `bilingual-ai-flashcards-early-childhood-education`, `chineseCostumeHistoryInfographic`, `chineseHerbalMedicineVisualGuide`, `contentMultiplicationSystem`, `contentTaggingSystem`, `creativeAiToolsWebsites`, `curifyAiGrowthEngine`, `emotionTtsMovie`, `evolutionTimelinesVisualization`, `f5TtsVsElevenlabs`, `imageToNarrativeVideo`, `nanoBananaDedicated`, `preserveFacialFeaturesAiGeneration`, `seriesInfographicVsNotebookLM`, `ugcVideoTranslationScalingTiktoksShortsGlobalMarkets`, `video_translation_eval`, `viralLearningContent`, `visualLearningTools`, `whatIsInfographics`.
- Bumped `lastmod` for **25 catalog slugs** in `public/data/blogs.json` (1 orphan: `video_translation_eval` has a namespace in `blog.json` but no catalog entry — see "Discoveries" below).
- Fanned out to 9 non-en locales via `scripts/i18n_autotranslate.cjs --base en --files blog --write` — 130-146 new keys per locale (`metaDescription` + `seoKeywords` array elements + the 3 rewritten P0 intros/body fields cleared first so autotranslate refilled them).

### New coverage stats (post-sweep)
| Metric | Before | After |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Real posts with `metaDescription` | 24 / 54 | **48 / 54** |
| Catalog entries with `lastmod` | ~11 / 57 | **36 / 57** |

The 6 entries still missing meta are 5 shared keys (`metadata`, `footer` … no, that's an empty string title — `finalThought`, `keyInsight`, `metadata`, `pinterestPlatform`, `ruleOfThumb`) and 1 orphan duplicate (`ugc-video-translation-scaling-tiktoks-shorts-global-markets` — kebab-case dup of the live camel namespace; gets resolved during dup consolidation, not the meta sweep).

### Discoveries
- **`mbti-relationship-style-visualizer` namespace is `mbiRelationshipStyleVisualizer`** — the typo (no "t" after "mb") is preserved intentionally because the dedicated `app/[locale]/(public)/blog/mbti-relationship-style-visualizer/page.tsx` hard-codes `useTranslations('blog.mbiRelationshipStyleVisualizer')`. Don't rename — you'll break the page.
- **`mbti-character-generator` also has its own dedicated route folder** alongside `how-to-dub-videos-naturally` and `mbti-relationship-style-visualizer`. So the dedicated-folder set is now 3, not 1. Always run `ls app/[locale]/(public)/blog/` before assuming the `[slug]` pipeline.
- **`video_translation_eval` is an orphan namespace** — exists in `messages/en/blog.json` but no matching slug in `public/data/blogs.json`. Either drop it from messages or add a catalog entry; flagged for the consolidation pass.

## Progress in the last 7 days (2026-05-10 → 2026-05-17)

### Bleeder stops — title + meta only (10 posts)
| Commit | Post | Lever |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `0803aab` | f5-tts-voice-cloning | "ElevenLabs head-to-head review" framing |
| `0803aab` | what-is-voice-cloning | Tighter meta only (title kept) |
| `0803aab` | voice-cloning-tools | Comparison framing |
| `0803aab` | 10-prompting-tips-video-generation | Sora / Runway / Pika specifics |
| `0803aab` | lip-sync-technical-deep-dive | Production credibility angle |
| `0803aab` | translate-youtube-video | Three-method scope |
| `0803aab` | ai-youtube-video-translator | Hub framing for video dubbing |
| `bb5a8b2` + `4de9e76` | image-generation-model-comparison | Title + meta + lastmod bump |
| `4d24885` | how-to-dub-videos-naturally | Title + bespoke-layout meta override |

Combined SC impressions at the time of `0803aab`: ~10,192 impressions / 10 clicks across the 7 — i.e. <0.1% CTR. Watch for CTR lift over the next 2-4 weeks before declaring it a win.

### Significant content rewrites (5 posts)
| Commit | Post | What changed |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `91c9e91` | character-prompt-generator | Rewrote anchored in 12+ universe MBTI templates |
| `33d7c8f` | mbti-character-generator | Rewrote anchored in 17 MBTI templates |
| `4b46c34` | ultimate-directory-of-nano-banana-prompts | Full rewrite — directory linked to live prompts |
| `a05a488` | 10-prompting-tips-nano-banana | Fixed stale template IDs, wired real template cards |
| `42fd681` | ai-collage-digital-wallpaper-guide | Dropped GSC stats, wired real template cards |

### Plumbing / infra
- `ac14131` — **Unified blog CTA card** (`BlogCTACard.tsx`) by category, with `useClickTracking` firing `blog-cta:<category>:<cta-id>` so the admin funnel can answer "which categories actually convert to tool / coaching / contact." See [CTA review](#cta-section-review) below.
- `4de9e76` — Per-blog `lastmod` in `public/data/blogs.json` and the sitemap reads it. Previously the sitemap emitted `new Date()` for every blog on every fetch, neutering the lastmod signal entirely.
- `aeec187` — Shared blog top bar (search + breadcrumb + locale switcher).
- `3a8c075` + `d28cca6` — Split `10-prompting-tips-nano-banana` into two posts; i18n fan-out to 9 non-en locales.
- `198132a` — `QA_Bot_to_Task` namespace path fix.
- `414e104` — `character-prompt-generator` hero image trimmed to `max-w-xs`.

## Evaluation of remaining blogs

`messages/en/blog.json` contains **60 entries** under `blog.*`. Of those, **6 are shared keys** (`metadata`, `footer`, `finalThought`, `keyInsight`, `ruleOfThumb`, `pinterestPlatform`) — so the real post count is **~54**. Coverage gap: **24 real posts still have no `metaDescription`**.

### P0 — strategy-doc leaks visible to readers
**Status: all three closed on 2026-05-17.** Intros rewritten, body strategy-leak fields sanitised, i18n fan-out done. See [Today's progress](#todays-progress-2026-05-17-after-the-morning-push) above for details.

~~1. `mbiRelationshipStyleVisualizer`~~ — fixed.
~~2. `weirdScienceFactsClassroomEngagement`~~ — fixed.
~~3. `whatIsInfographics`~~ — fixed (intro replaced + meta added).

### P1 — obvious AI-marketing fluff (next sweep)
Same telltales we already rewrote on the P0 posts: openings like "Discover how…", "Learn how to…", "Comprehensive guide to…", or "is revolutionizing / reshaping / transforming…", plus benefit-bullet boilerplate that doesn't reference actual templates or tool URLs.

| Post | Telltale (first ~40 words of intro) |
| --- | --- |
| ~~`whatIsInfographics`~~ | ~~Intro literally reads `"Latest Article"` — **broken / placeholder**, treat as P0~~ — **fixed 2026-05-17** (see line above; intro now anchored in cross-medium use cases) |
| ~~`aslVideoTranslator`~~ | ~~"Learn how to translate ASL video using advanced AI tools and computer vision…"~~ — **rewritten 2026-05-23** (commit `9fbf3b2`); anchored in NMS-as-syntax, continuous-signing recognition, topic-comment grammar, honest tool comparison |
| ~~`bilingual-ai-flashcards-early-childhood-education`~~ | ~~"Learn how to generate highly visual bilingual AI flashcards…"~~ — **full body rewrite 2026-05-23** (Path-B batch); anchored in toddler vocab retention, 5-step workflow, 3 ready-to-use template prompts |

### P2 — audit needed
No fluffy intro to flag, but body untouched in the last sweep and unlikely to be anchored. Skim before deciding rewrite vs leave:

`aiContentDistributionSystem`, `aiContentProductionSystem`, `creativeAiToolsWebsites`, `curifyNanoBananaTemplateTips` (newly split, worth a re-skim), `chineseHerbalMedicineVisualGuide`, `contentMultiplicationSystem`, `contentTaggingSystem` (intro is actually good — "When you have thousands of images…"), `preserveFacialFeaturesAiGeneration`, `nanoBananaDedicated`, `bestAiTools`, `visualLearningTools`, `viralLearningContent`, `aiVideoDubbingTutorial`, `emotionTtsMovie`, `curifyAiGrowthEngine`, `aeVsComfyUi`, `redCarpetAiLooks`, `seriesInfographicVsNotebookLM`, `nanoBananaDedicated`, `video_translation_eval`.

### Duplicates / orphans to consolidate
**Status: all 4 pairs + orphan + contamination closed 2026-05-18 (second push).** See [Today's progress (2026-05-18, second push)](#todays-progress-2026-05-18-second-push--duplicate-consolidation) for the commit-by-commit table.

| Pair | Resolution |
| --- | --- |
| ~~`ugc-video-translation-scaling-tiktoks-shorts-global-markets` vs `ugcVideoTranslationScalingTiktoksShortsGlobalMarkets`~~ | Camel namespace deleted (`e57377f`). |
| ~~`aiCollageDigitalWallpaperGuide` vs `gridCollageAiPrompts`~~ | `gridCollageAiPrompts` + folder deleted, 301 redirect added (`a7011b7`). |
| ~~`f5TtsVoiceCloning` vs `f5TtsVsElevenlabs`~~ | `f5TtsVsElevenlabs` + folder deleted, 301 redirect added (`f11608f`). |
| ~~`videoTranscriptionTechnicalDeepDive` vs `translateYoutubeVideoToEnglish`~~ | Both kept alive; intros differentiated by funnel (`7ef4e04`). |

### Coverage stats
- **48 / 54 real posts** now have `metaDescription` (was 24 / 54 before 2026-05-17). Remaining 6 are 5 shared keys + 1 orphan kebab dup — no real post is uncovered.
- **36 / 57 catalog entries** now have `lastmod` (was ~11 / 57). The other 21 are untouched-since-publish — top sitemap re-crawl candidates if those posts later need a CTR refresh.

## CTA section review

### Current mapping (`app/[locale]/_components/BlogCTACard.tsx`)
**Refactored 2026-05-17.** Single source of truth for the bottom-of-post CTA — no in-body duplicates, no nano-template grid links.

| Category | Primary | Secondary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `video-translation-dubbing` / `video-dubbing` | Try Video Dubbing → `/tools/video-dubbing` | Partner with us → `/contact` |
| `creator-tools` | Per-post tool override (e.g. `/tools/video-transcription`) or `/tools` index | _none_ |
| `ds-ai-engineering` | Book AI / DS Coaching → MentorCruise (external) | Partner with us → `/contact` |
| `content-automation` | Talk to us about a pilot → `/contact` | Book 15 min → Calendly (external) |
| `nano-template` | Partner on custom templates → `/contact` | Browse Creator Tools → `/tools` |
| `learning-education` | Partner on edtech → `/contact` | Browse Creator Tools → `/tools` |

Click tracking: `content_id = blog-cta:<category>:<cta-id>`, `content_type = menu_link`. Greppable in the admin Actions panel.

Per-post creator-tools overrides table (`CREATOR_TOOL_OVERRIDES` in `BlogCTACard.tsx`): add an entry whenever a creator-tools post maps to a specific tool. Currently wired for `video-transcription-business-guide`, `10-prompting-tips-video-generation`. Worth filling in as the tool catalog grows.

### Gaps / concerns — _resolved 2026-05-17 unless noted_
1. ~~`nano-template` has no CTA card.~~ Now maps to `/contact` (primary) + `/tools` (secondary).
2. ~~`learning-education` has no CTA card.~~ Now maps to `/contact` (primary) + `/tools` (secondary).
3. ~~`creator-tools` CTA is generic.~~ Per-post override table added; expand as new posts ship.
4. ~~`ds-ai-engineering` → MentorCruise only.~~ Added `/contact` secondary.
5. ~~`content-automation` → mailto + /contact.~~ Replaced mailto with Calendly direct link (still secondary to `/contact`).
6. **Single bottom-of-post placement.** Still true. Long posts (`preserveFacialFeaturesAiGeneration` at 190 keys, `f5TtsVsElevenlabs` at 144) probably lose readers before the CTA. Cheap upgrade: an inline mid-post strip anchored after the first major section. Open.
7. **Generic header copy** — `Take the next step` / `Putting what you read into practice`. Category-specific copy would resonate better. Open.

## Next-up shortlist

Reprioritized 2026-05-17 after the CTA consolidation push. Top of list is now the layout streamline — it touches every reader on every blog and undergirds everything else (rewrites, CTA visual polish, mid-post inline CTA).

### 1. Layout & visual polish — _new top priority_
Uniform basic layout across every blog (both `[slug]` pipeline and dedicated-folder pages) and the blog feed page. Scope:

- **No giant hero images** at the top of posts. Drop the floated `max-w-sm` hero from `app/[locale]/(public)/blog/[slug]/page.tsx` (and the equivalent in each dedicated-folder page). Either remove entirely, shrink to an inline thumbnail next to the title, or hoist to a true edge-to-edge banner if the image is worth that real estate — pick one pattern and apply everywhere.
- **Relaxed reading width** on every blog body and the feed. Today the `<article>` runs to whatever the parent provides; cap it for readable line length (~ 65-75 ch) on the body, keep the hero/feed cards on a wider container. Affected:
  - `[slug]/page.tsx` body article wrapper
  - The 5 dedicated-folder pages (`how-to-dub-videos-naturally`, `mbti-character-generator`, `mbti-relationship-style-visualizer`, `weird-science-facts-classroom-engagement`, `ai-collage-digital-wallpaper-guide`)
  - Blog feed page (`app/[locale]/(public)/blog/page.tsx` if it exists, or the listing wrapped elsewhere)
- **Consistent alignment.** Pick one and apply: most blog body text left-aligned, headings left-aligned, CTA / hero strips centered, captions left under image. Today there's a mix of `text-center` and default-left blocks across components.
- **CTA card theme — light purple + light blue.** `BlogCTACard.tsx` currently uses `border-blue-200` / `from-blue-50 to-white`. Rework to a two-tone light-purple + light-blue scheme (e.g. left card light-blue, right card light-purple; or unified gradient `from-purple-50 to-blue-50`). Keep the existing icon + tracking wiring.

Owner judgement call on each — these are design choices, not mechanical fixes. **Folds in the previously-separate "CTA polish (inline mid-post, category-specific headers)" item**, since both need to land in the same design pass.

### 2. Duplicate consolidation
**All 4 pairs + orphan + contamination shipped 2026-05-18 (second push).** See [Today's progress](#todays-progress-2026-05-18-second-push--duplicate-consolidation) for the commit-by-commit table. Net cleanup: ~6,200 lines across `blog.json`, 2 dedicated-folder routes removed, 4 new 301 redirects in `next.config.ts`.

### 3. Author the missing `contentTaggingSystem` sub-trees
`keyInsight.methods`, `pinterestPlatform.templateTags.geoTags.examples`, `…languageTags.examples`, `finalThought.systems`, `footer.tags`. The page no longer crashes, but those sections render empty until authored.

### 4. P1 fluff rewrite — top 5 by Search Console impressions
**All five shipped 2026-05-18.** See [Today's progress](#todays-progress-2026-05-18--p1-rewrites--2-new-dsai-posts) for commits + per-post fields touched. Next P1 cohort is gated on the post-2026-06-01 SC re-pull — most current P2 candidates are likely the right next batch once we see which positions moved.

### 5. P0 / P1 CTR follow-up
After 2026-06-01, re-pull Search Console for **15 rewritten posts**:
- 10 bleeders rewritten in `0803aab` + `bb5a8b2` + `4d24885`
- 3 P0 rewrites from 2026-05-17 (`mbiRelationshipStyleVisualizer`, `weirdScienceFactsClassroomEngagement`, `whatIsInfographics`)
- ~~3 P1 rewrites from~~ **5 P1 rewrites from 2026-05-18** (`9c8fe83`, `b533c55`, `db74b3e`, `b5925db`, `250e2b6`)

Lift > 2× CTR ⇒ the playbook is working; lift flat ⇒ try a stronger framing or a different position-rank cohort.

### 6. P2 audit pass
Skim the ~20 P2 bodies. If anchored in real templates and tools, leave alone; otherwise add to a future P1 list. The SC re-pull at #5 will reveal which P2 posts now matter most.

## SERP-emulation learnings for nano-banana / prompt-focused posts (added 2026-05-27)

Audit of the top SERP result for `brazil prompt` (`https://sajjadit.com/ai-soccer-poster-prompt-argentina-brazil/`, 2,000-2,500 words) surfaced five structural patterns missing from our nano-banana corpus. The Curify version shipped at `/blog/brazil-argentina-soccer-poster-prompts` adopts all five; the existing nano-banana posts (`nano-banana-prompt-ecosystem`, `10-prompting-tips-nano-banana`, `curify-nano-banana-template-tips`, `ultimate-directory-of-nano-banana-prompts`, `nano-banana-dedicated`) should be backfilled with these where applicable.

1. **Copyable prompt blocks (explicit copy UI).** Triple-backtick code blocks already render as `<pre><code>` via `formatContent`, which the user can select/copy. Prompt-focused posts should put every recommended prompt inside a code block. Today many of our prompts are buried in prose.

2. **Per-country/team/topic permutation as long-tail strategy.** sajjadit.com's sidebar lists Morocco, Portugal, Germany, France posts — each post hits a different long-tail query with the same structural skeleton. We should ship variants for high-search-volume entities (each World Cup nation, each MBTI universe, each tier-1 topic) where the structural cost of authoring drops to near-zero after the first one.

3. **AI tools mini-comparison table.** Standard inclusion in prompt-focused SERP winners — readers want to know which model fits before they commit to one. The four-column shape (Tool / Best for / Strength / Weakness) takes ~15 minutes to write and dramatically improves dwell time. Already in the new soccer-poster post and `image-generation-model-comparison`; backfill into the nano-banana directory + ecosystem posts.

4. **Settings & keyword vocabulary section.** Lens choice (`85mm portrait`, `wide-angle action`), lighting cue (`golden hour`, `floodlight glare`, `rim lighting`), color grading vocabulary (`teal-orange grade`, `commercial color grade`), negative prompts (`no warped jersey numbers`). This section feeds search-by-aesthetic queries that prompt-content readers actually type. Most existing nano-banana posts skip this entirely.

5. **"Other variants — same prompt, swap the entity" closer.** The conclusion of every prompt-focused post should be a list of 8-10 entity permutations with the prompt-shape held constant. Tells the reader: this post is one of many; here are the natural next searches. Sajjadit ends with "Morocco, France, Germany, Portugal" pointers. Our soccer post ends with 9 national-team variants. Should backfill into the nano-banana posts (e.g., the directory post's conclusion could end with "Other prompt families — same pattern: character, design, lifestyle, learning").

**Methodology captured for future GSC-driven posts:** `feedback_gsc_serp_emulation.md` in memory. The cadence is: pull weekly `Queries.csv` → find emergent queries with non-zero CTR at position 8-25 → WebFetch top-1 SERP result → audit structure → ship Curify version anchored in real templates.

## Significant rewrite tracker (fluff reduction)

_Living log of posts that underwent significant content rewriting to improve quality and reduce AI marketing flavour. Distinguished from the bleeder track (title + meta only) — these are body-level rewrites that materially change the reader experience. Add a row every time a post crosses the "substantial content swap" bar so we can measure cumulative quality lift across the catalog._

**Telltales that triggered a rewrite:** unverifiable claims ("10k+ creators", "47% higher engagement", "X faster"), opening clichés ("revolutionizing", "the pinnacle of"), benefit-bullet boilerplate with no real anchors, marketing slogans masquerading as conclusions ("Distribution is the new differentiation"), or sections that read identical across multiple posts (mass-generated from one template).

| Date | Slug | Scope | What changed |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2026-05-25 | `programmatic-seo-dtc-visual-first` | intro + market gap + curify section | Killed "AI marketing fluff" intro, labeled the two walls explicitly, acknowledged the market gap before pitching Curify. |
| 2026-05-25 | `multimodal-ai-educational-publishing` | full rewrite | Condensed from a 5,000-CN-char whitepaper to a ~12-min English deep-dive anchored in real Curify capabilities (deterministic templates, F5-TTS cross-lingual, MuseTalk). |
| 2026-05-25 | `ai-content-factory-for-agencies` | full rewrite | Original brief shipped; agency-buyer narrative anchored in batch-generation + autopost as proof. |
| 2026-05-27 | `nano-banana-prompt-ecosystem` | full library-tour rewrite | Replaced 11 sections of SEO keyword-stuffing with 4 visual library-by-tag sections (mood / subject / style / lighting+seasonal) anchored in real gallery thumbnails + tag pages. Deleted fluff sections (ecosystem, seo, generator, useCases, integration, community, conclusion). |
| 2026-05-27 | `nano-banana-prompt-ecosystem` (de-numbered) | counts + internal-path leaks | Replaced exact counts (4,117, 145 tags, per-tag chip counts) with vague phrasing ("4,000+", "many attributes") since gallery sync changes numbers daily. Removed `lib/taxonomy.json` internal-file references from prose. |
| 2026-05-27 | `translate-youtube-video-to-english` | full rewrite | Engineering deep-dive → solutions how-to with 3 methods (auto-subtitles / full dub / bilingual subtitles), differentiated from sibling `ai-youtube-video-translator`. |
| 2026-05-27 | `image-generation-model-comparison` | retitle + rewrite | "DALL-E 3 vs Midjourney vs Stable Diffusion" → "Midjourney vs Nano Banana vs Stable Diffusion". Refreshed 2026 model lineup (GPT Image 2 transition, Nano Banana Pro, MMDiT-X), added 4-tool comparison table, added newer-contenders closer. |
| 2026-05-28 | `ai-content-distribution-system` | full rewrite + Mermaid fix | Condensed 7+ steps to 4 named stages (Format Adaptation / Niche-First Distribution / Performance Instrumentation / Feedback into Next Batch). Replaced marketing slogans ("good distribution can save average content") with concrete numbers (5-10× niche engagement, 30-50% bilingual lift, 5 pieces/week manual cap). Removed visible "🔍 SEO Keywords" footer. Fixed Mermaid component for v11 API. |
| 2026-05-28 | `10-prompting-tips-nano-banana` | tip 10 + curify + conclusion rewrite + tips 1-10 anchored in real gallery prompts + rendering pipeline fix | Pivoted from "templates" anchor to "gallery prompts" anchor. Tip 10 = "Start From a Gallery Prompt, Not a Blank Page" with worked example (real gallery prompt id=4190). curifyContent rewritten as "Where to find prompts that already work" with subject-led + aesthetic-led browsing patterns. Differentiated from the Library directory post. **Second pass**: tipExamples 1-7 each get a real gallery prompt (id + image + tag chips) replacing the synthetic example text, plus a "why this lands" callout pointing at the specific principle being demonstrated. **Third pass**: tips 8 (negative prompts) and 9 (multi-turn iteration) get gallery anchors too — tip 8 uses /4314 (winter samurai portrait) framed for targeted negative prompts; tip 9 uses /4170 (golden hour airport traveler) as the Turn 1 base with 3 explicit follow-up iteration patterns. Tip 10 gets its image embed added. Dropped the "Popular Template Examples" section (NanoBananaExamples component). **Rendering pipeline fix**: tipNExample rendering switched from PromptBox + `<pre>` (which displayed the gallery markdown as raw text — what the user called "i18n key issues") to formatNanoBananaContent so images, blockquotes, and markdown links all render properly. |

| 2026-05-28 | `red-carpet-ai-looks` | intro + structural cleanup | Removed the gradient "Generate Fashion Looks with Nano Banana" CTA section (linked at /tools, not the right destination for prompt-readers). Removed the "Annual Refresh Note" block (fake-periodicity claim that the guide updates "every May and February"). Tightened intro — dropped "pinnacle of style innovation" framing for concrete observation about the corpus of red carpet looks and the four things that distinguish a fashion shot. Article width relaxed max-w-4xl → max-w-5xl. Fixed hardcoded `locale="en"` on RelatedBlogs. Style archetypes, prompt anatomy, and pitfalls table preserved — they're the concrete content. |
| 2026-05-29 | `red-carpet-ai-looks` (follow-up) | gallery template anchors | Added a "From the gallery" 3-up grid between corePromptRecipe and styleArchetypes — Met Gala / Paris Fashion Week / Couture gown design sheet template links with CdnImage cards. No body-copy edits; visual bridge from recipe to working template. |
| 2026-05-29 | `preserve-facial-features-ai-generation` | structural dedup + new mechanics section + concrete examples + real gallery visuals | **Top untouched bleeder** on 5/25 GSC (3c / 451imp / 0.67% CTR). Hero image migrated to [slug] adaptive convention. Removed dead-button gradient "Use Template" CTA + dead-link "Next Steps Character Journey" 2-card section (both were broken on prod) — BlogCTACard is now the only next-step surface. Visual examples (3 fabricated thumbnails) swapped for 3 live lifestyle-photo-grid template anchors (Met Gala / Paris Fashion Week / Wedding) — that template literally renders the SAME face across 9 scenes, which IS the post's thesis. `styleTransferFormula` code block replaced `[CHARACTER_FACE_BLUEPRINT] rendered in [art_style]` placeholders with a real worked prompt. **New section: "The Mechanics Behind the Lock"** — 3 levers most prompt guides skip: (1) Pin the seed in Gemini API (worked code block), (2) token weighting syntax `(deep-set hazel eyes:1.3)` for drift-prone features, (3) surgical negatives that name actual failure modes. en messages: `nanoBananaMethodExample` placeholder → real prompt, `biggestChallengeOutro` dropped "masterclass techniques", `nanoBananaSolutionDesc` dropped "DNA for your character" metaphor. 17 new keys + 4 rewrite keys fanned to 9 non-en locales. |
| 2026-05-29 | `voice-cloning-tools` | full body rewrite + dedicated component + honest Curify framing | **Biggest impression bleeder in the catalog** on 5/25 GSC (752 impr / 0 clicks; title+meta tweak in 5/13 cohort regressed CTR from 0.25% → 0%). Diagnosis: title sold a tool comparison; body delivered an F5-TTS dubbing-ops deep dive (WER, GPU pools, FCC TCPA, C2PA manifests). Reader landing on "best voice cloning tools" wanted to pick a tool, got an enterprise SRE playbook. **New dedicated component** `VoiceCloningToolsContent.tsx`; slug branch added to [slug]/page.tsx BEFORE the shared `voice-cloning*` branch so the sibling posts (`what-is-voice-cloning`, `f5-tts-voice-cloning`) keep the shared renderer untouched. New schema: intro that rejects the 10-tool listicle pattern; "Who this is for" audience filter; 3 color-banded per-tool detail boxes (ElevenLabs / F5-TTS / OpenVoice) each with tagline + 4-field micro-list (Best for / Pricing / Languages / Limitation) + "when to pick" paragraph; side-by-side comparison table; decision rubric "pick by use case"; gradient-banded **Curify callout** positioned honestly as "what if you don't need a voice cloning *tool*?" — Curify is a dubbing tool, voice cloning is internal, not a category competitor to ElevenLabs (user explicitly flagged the depth gap); compliance section retained from prior body (TCPA / consent / disclosure — genuinely useful, rare in SERP competitors). 32 new keys + 19 obsolete keys dropped. Non-en locales: voiceCloningTools wiped entirely + rebuilt by autotranslate from en (old schema structurally obsolete; partial overlap would have shipped a Frankenstein per-locale). All 10 locales: 43 keys populated, 0 ICU parse failures. WebFetch on the SERP target (autoppt.com) returns 403; per-tool detail copy + intro hook will refine after user sends screenshots. |

**Cumulative status as of 2026-05-29:** 13 significant content rewrites since 2026-05-25 (5 days). Roughly 2-3 per day. At this pace the P2 backlog (~20 posts) would clear in ~2 weeks of focused work.
